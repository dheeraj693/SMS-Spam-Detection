# SMS-Spam-Detection

📌 SMS Spam Detection – Project Description

This project is an SMS Spam Detection System that classifies text messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Machine Learning techniques. With the rise of digital communication, spam messages have become a major concern. This project aims to solve that problem by automatically identifying spam messages with high accuracy.

🔹 Features

Classifies SMS messages into Spam or Not Spam

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text preprocessing

Implements Machine Learning algorithms for classification

User-friendly implementation for easy prediction

🔹 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy for data handling

Scikit-learn for ML model building

NLTK for text preprocessing (stopwords, stemming, tokenization)

Streamlit / Flask (optional) for interactive UI

🔹 Dataset

The dataset used is the popular SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains thousands of SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham".

🔹 Workflow

Load dataset and clean the data

Preprocess text (remove stopwords, punctuation, stemming, etc.)

Convert text into TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words features

Train classification models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)

Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Predict user-given SMS messages

🔹 Example

Input: "Congratulations! You have won a free lottery. Claim now!"

Output: Spam

Input: "Hey, are we meeting today?"

Output: Not Spam

🔹 Future Improvements

Deploy as a web app for real-time SMS spam detection

Use deep learning models (LSTM, BERT) for better accuracy

Integrate with email/SMS systems for automatic filtering
